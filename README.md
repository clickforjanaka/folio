<h3 align="middle">This is future nanny, Storyteller for babies</h3>
Physiologists say, “You can always get a view from a hill and being 4 is like the first developmental hill from which your child can get a view of a bigger world.”  Age 3-5 is the period which the brain develops the most. As a parent they have huge responsibility for interacting with their child and do the things what they have to, but today there is a problem with that. Parents are busy with their schedules and they have a little time to interact with their kids. That’s why day-cares and nannies are common in Sri Lanka. This is not a good sign. Folio will overcome the problem of having less interaction and provide the hands-on strategies that the kids need. Its not distancing the relationship between parents and children nut simplifies the relationship and makes it easy for parents.
<br>
With Folio, a child can learn on his own without any support of others. He can either listen to story or colour the pictures according to the coloured picture which is showing in the mobile or tablet screen. Specially for under four-year-old we are recommending phone holder which holds the device over the folio-book which makes it easier.

(Additionally, we used Android Studio IDE to develop the native application.)  

<h1 align="middle">Analysis of the system</h1>
<h2 align="middle">Functional Specification</h2>

In this project when it come up with the functional specification, below there are some important facts we highly concern about.

•	Ability of reading QR code
when a kid selects any image (blank sketch) he/she should have to scan for the QR code for the coloured image and audio track. There for this app should have the ability of reading QR code.

•	Ability of recognize the similar image to each QR code
Each image has its own QR code which identically recognized its coloured image and audio track. When user scan the QR code it should be able to recognize its similar coloured image.

•	Ability of sending coloured images from database that matches to blank image
When it recognized the similar coloured image, it should be able to retrieve that coloured image from database and display it through the application. 

•	Capability of recognizing and retrieving the matching audio to the each QR code 
Each image has its own QR code which identically recognized its audio track. When someone scan the QR code it should be able to recognize the relevant audio track and retrieve it from database and make it playable on the app.

•	Capability of pause, replay, stop the audio
The audio track should be able to pause, replay and stop according to the user preferences.

•	Ability of mute, increase and decrease the volume 
The audio track should be able to perform the tasks of mute, increase and decrease the volume according to the user preferences.

<h2 align="middle">Benefits of The Proposed System</h2>

•	Practice child to do things on his own, from the earlier stage.

In Sri Lanka teachers have to spoon-feed everything to the students because on the earlier stage parents did not teaches them to do things on its own. But in European countries things happen much different. With folio parent only need to give proper guidance and child practice to learn on its own without spoon-feeding.

•	Fit for parents’ busy schedules

Since parents only need to give guidance parents can do multiple things while child is learning new things. For example, mother can cook meals while child interacting with application on the near desk. This saves the money which spend for nannies or babysitters.

•	Child development

Folio is a hybrid solution which is capable for improve many areas of the child.

<h1 align="middle">Future Implementation</h1>

Additional interactions with the kids such as, touching the picture which then will play short enjoyable animations will be added.

Sketch recognition will be implemented with AR(Augmented Reality) to demonstrate the colouring process with animations.

Voice recognition which will trigger various audio responses related to the cartoon character will be implemented.
